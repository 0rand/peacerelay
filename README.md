## What:
Peace Relay is a system of smart contracts that aim to allow for cross-EVM-chain communication using relay contracts. 

These contracts will be able to verifiy merkle-patricia proofs about state, transactions, or receipts within specific blocks. 

This, along with the wonderful Ethash verification work done by SmartPool, allows for trustless cross chain transfers of all tokens on any EVM chain.
